Mock Pantheon catalog generated in fully nonlinear general relativity

This repository contains the synthetic distance-redshift data used to constrain H0 as presented in http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09659. This data was generated from numerical relativity simulations of large-scale structure combined with fully general-relativistic ray tracing calculations. 

We share the luminosity distances, distance modulus, and redshifts for two simulations (see the paper for details). 

Any use of this data in publications or presentations please cite the paper at the above link: Macpherson (2024).
